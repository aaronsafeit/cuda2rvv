CUDA2RVV: CUDA to RISC-V Vector Abstraction Layer
Overview
CUDA2RVV is an experimental abstraction and emulation layer designed to enable CUDA applications and libraries (such as PyTorch, OpenCV, and others in the Anaconda ecosystem) to run on RISC-V processors with vector extensions (RVV). This project facilitates porting CUDA kernels by translating CUDA constructs, intrinsics, and runtime APIs into RVV-compatible equivalents and software-emulated threading models.

Features
CUDA Kernel Execution Model Emulation
Emulates CUDA thread/block/grid hierarchy using POSIX threads and RVV vector masking to simulate warp-level and block-level parallelism.

Memory Management
Provides CUDA-like memory APIs (cudaMalloc, cudaFree, cudaMemcpy) mapped to a unified memory model compatible with RVV systems.

Warp-level Primitives
Implements warp-synchronous operations (__shfl_sync, __ballot_sync) via RVV instructions and software masking to replicate CUDA’s warp communication features.

Texture and Surface Memory Emulation
Supports CUDA texture and surface memory APIs for GPU-accelerated image processing kernels.

Atomic Operations and Synchronization
Maps CUDA atomic operations and synchronization primitives to RISC-V atomic and vector instructions and POSIX thread barriers.

Modular Header Structure
Organized into specific headers for core execution (cuda2rvv.h), warp operations (cuda2rvv_warp.h), memory management (cuda2rvv_memory.h), texture memory (cuda2rvv_texture.h), unified memory (cuda2rvv_unified.h), ballot operations (cuda2rvv_ballot.h), and mask management (cuda2rvv_mask.h).

CUDA Runtime Shim
A C++ runtime shim layer emulates essential CUDA runtime APIs and kernel launches using pthreads and RVV, facilitating compatibility with existing CUDA codebases.

Goals
Enable porting and execution of CUDA-dependent software stacks (e.g., PyTorch, OpenCV) on RISC-V vector hardware.

Provide a foundational software layer for CUDA emulation without requiring native NVIDIA hardware.

Support future expansion towards full CUDA API coverage, improved performance, and enhanced concurrency.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
RISC-V system or simulator supporting RVV extensions

Clang/LLVM toolchain with RISC-V backend

POSIX-compliant OS (for pthread support)

Building
The project provides modular headers and a runtime shim. Integrate into your build system and compile CUDA kernels via a custom CUDA2RVV frontend or manually adapted code.

#include "cuda2rvv.h"
#include "cuda2rvv_runtime.cpp"

// Example CUDA kernel adapted for CUDA2RVV
__global__ void vector_add_kernel(const float* A, const float* B, float* C, int N) {
    int i = threadIdx_x;
    if (i < N) {
        C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    constexpr int N = 64;
    float A[N], B[N], C[N];
    // Initialize A and B...

    cudaMalloc((void**)&devA, sizeof(float)*N);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&devB, sizeof(float)*N);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&devC, sizeof(float)*N);

    cudaMemcpy(devA, A, sizeof(float)*N, 0);
    cudaMemcpy(devB, B, sizeof(float)*N, 0);

    cudaLaunchKernel((cuda_kernel_t)vector_add_kernel, nullptr, dim3(1), dim3(N));

    cudaMemcpy(C, devC, sizeof(float)*N, 1);

    cudaFree(devA);
    cudaFree(devB);
    cudaFree(devC);

    // Validate results...

    return 0;
}

Limitations & Future Work
Current threading model uses pthreads and does not yet support full grid-stride looping.

Memory model assumes unified memory; device-only or managed memory semantics need enhancement.

Warp-level primitives are emulated in software, which may impact performance.

Stream and event APIs are stubbed; full asynchronous kernel execution is pending.

Integration with complex CUDA-dependent libraries requires ongoing adaptation and testing.
